## Requirements

To use this chatbot, you need the following:

- A system capable of running Python 3.8 or later.
- At least **16GB of RAM** (32GB recommended for running Llama 3.1).
- A **GPU** (optional but recommended for faster inference with large models).
- A stable internet connection for pulling the Llama 3.1 model.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Ollama

Ollama is required to manage and run the Llama 3.1 model. Download and install it from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.ai/download).

Once installed, verify it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ollama
```
You should see a help menu or version output indicating Ollama is installed correctly.

---

### Step 2: Pull the Llama 3.1 Model

Use the following commands to pull and verify the Llama 3.1 model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama list
```
The `ollama list` command should display `llama3.1` as one of the available models.

---

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

Run the following commands to install all necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-ollama
pip install ollama
pip install pathlib
```

These dependencies include libraries for managing the AI model, building the chatbot interface, and running it as a web app. Specifically, ensure the following libraries are available in your environment:

- `streamlit`: For creating the chatbot interface.
- `datetime`: For handling timestamps.
- `langchain-ollama`: For integrating Llama 3.1 with LangChain.
- `langchain-core`: For prompts and chaining logic.
- `os`: For handling file and directory operations.
- `pathlib`: For creating and managing directories.
- `socket`: For obtaining user IP.

### Step 4: Clone the GitHub Repository

Download the project code from the Digital Health repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DigitalHealthpe/DH_chatbot.git
cd DH_chatbot
```

---

### Step 5: Run the Chatbot

Start the chatbot by running the following command from the project directory:

```bash
streamlit run main.py --server.port 8501
```

This will launch the chatbot on `http://localhost:8501` by default. Open this URL in your browser to interact with the chatbot.
